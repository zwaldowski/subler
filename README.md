Subler
======

Overview
--------

Subler is an app for OS X created to mux MP4 files. The main features are:

 * Create `tx3g` subtitle tracks, compatible with QuickTime, iTunes, and all Apple and iOS devices.
 * Mux video, audio, chapters, subtitles and closed captions tracks from `mov`, `mp4` and `mkv` into a new file.
 * Metadata editing with automatic TMDb and TVDB support, compatible with iTunes.
 * Support for raw formats
   * H.264 Elementary streams (.h264, .264)
   * AAC (.aac)
   * AC3 (.ac3)
   * Scenarist (.scc)
   
Subler is based around the idea of "projects". In Subler, projects are represented by windows with a track listing at the top and the data from the tracks below. After creating a new project, you associate it with media tracks by ppening files from the File menu, or simply dragging and dropping them from the Finder into the project window. As each file is added, you will be asked which tracks you would like to read out of the file, adding them to the track list.

The project

This incarnation is forked from the project on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/subler/). Subler is created and maintained (somewhatâ€¦) by [Damiano Galassi](https://plus.google.com/100813725126121479712).
